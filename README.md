# paper-calendar

A useful calendar widget that you can use in various situations.

## Installation

Make sure you have installed Bower, then simply run  
`$ bower install --save Witus13/paper-pager`

This element is made for Hybrid mode so it should work with both Polymer 2.0 and 1.0 but it **hasn't been tested with 2.0 yet**

## Usage

The simplest way is to just import the element and then use it.
<!--
```
<custom-element-demo>
  <template>
    <link rel="import" href="paper-pager.html">
    <next-code-block></next-code-block>
  </template>
</custom-element-demo>
```
-->
```
<paper-calendar></paper-calendar>
```
